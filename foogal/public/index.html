        <p>
          What are we trying to achieve. <br/>
           We want to make buying and selling seamless and easy for 
            the  people who are located in close proximity to each other at the last mile of the delivery chain.
            They are the ones who provide the maximum value to the end customer and define <span>"Vocal for Local".</span><br/>
         </p> 

         <p>Benefits to the vendors. <br/>
          Making the nearby vendors, self reliant <span>"Atam-nirbhar".</span> 
          by providing an online platform to the smallest of businesses to showcase and sell their products.
          The entire platform has been modelled to keep the user experience as simple and as user friendly 
          as possible for both buyers and sellers.
          The application makes effective use of images from the identifying who the buyer and seller is to
          listing product and product details. Most of the input is one click based. Effective use of geo 
          tagging has ensured sellers and buyers are able to see products listed on the 
          Foogal marketplace within a radius of 5 km.
          </p> 

         <p>
          Benefits to the buyers.<br/>

          specific instructions.<br/><br/>
          The application also provides flexibility to increase the geographical area of business by favouritising any
